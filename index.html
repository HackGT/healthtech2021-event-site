            <h3>Mental Health</h3>
            <p>
                Mental health problems are some of the most common issues that
                are present throughout the world today. These problems can range
                from dealing with stress to certain disorders that affect daily
                lifestyles. Within this track, you will design solutions that
                improve the lifestyle of those affected by mental health issues.
            </p>

            <h3>Inpatient Health</h3>
            <p>
                It is essential that inpatients have the best possible
                experience during their stay in hospitals. In order to achieve
                this, hospitals must maintain the upmost standards in terms of
                sanitation, efficiency, and service. Participants within this
                track will design solutions that help keep these standards in
                the hospital.
            </p>

            <h3>Fitness & Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
                Maintaining a fitness routine is essential to living a healthy
                life. What's equally as important is that individuals must fuel
                their body with the right nutrients in order to keep their
                bodies in optimal shape; however, many people today face
                obstacles that keep them from receiving the necessary food.
                Within this track, participants will find ways to create a food
                and nutrition narrative: a new paradigm or a remaking of old
                ones that prioritizes and respects the central position of
                healthy, tasty, fair food in the human experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Women's Health</h3>
            <p>
                Women's health is often stigmatized and overlooked in numerous
                fields of health. They require different medical needs from men,
                and the PCOS Awareness organization is looking to bridge the gap
                and raise awareness. Participants in this track will help find
                ways to raise this awareness and to look for better ways to
                serve women's medical needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Global/Rural Health</h3>
            <p>
                Access to healthcare is limited in rural and less developed
                areas around the country and the world. It is important to
                expand access to quality healthcare in these areas, which could
                mean developing new technologies and infrastructure to expand
                the range of current medical services. Participants within this
                track will design solutions that increase access to healthcare,
                and/or find ways to make healthcare more affordable.

                        A hackathon is an invention marathon where people work
                        in groups to build hardware and software projects
                        ranging from simple websites to motion controlled
                        drones. At this hackathon, you will be working in teams
                        of up to four people to create projects within our
                        tracks [insert hyperlink of tracks].

                        Health Tech is modeled after the tech industry’s
                        “hackathon” and aims to foster collaboration among
                        students from various disciplines by uniting them for
                        their passion within the healthcare fields. Students
                        will work with nonprofit organizations to solve pressing
                        problems — from mental health to geriatrics – faced by
                        these groups in order to make a tangible impact within
                        in their community.
