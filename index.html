                    <p>
                        Mental health problems are some of the most common
                        issues that are present throughout the world today.
                        These problems can range from dealing with stress to
                        certain disorders that affect daily lifestyles. Within
                        this track, you will design solutions that improve the
                        lifestyle of those affected by mental health issues.

                    <p>
                        It is essential that inpatients have the best possible
                        experience during their stay in hospitals. In order to
                        achieve this, hospitals must maintain the upmost
                        standards in terms of sanitation, efficiency, and
                        service. Participants within this track will design
                        solutions that help keep these standards in the
                        hospital.

                    <p>
                        Maintaining a fitness routine is essential to living a
                        healthy life. What's equally as important is that
                        individuals must fuel their body with the right
                        nutrients in order to keep their bodies in optimal
                        shape; however, many people today face obstacles that
                        keep them from receiving the necessary food. Within this
                        track, participants will find ways to create a food and
                        nutrition narrative: a new paradigm or a remaking of old
                        ones that prioritizes and respects the central position
                        of healthy, tasty, fair food in the human experience.

                    <p>
                        Women's and reproductive health is often stigmatized and
                        overlooked in numerous fields of health. They require
                        different medical needs from men, and the PCOS Awareness
                        organization is looking to bridge the gap and raise
                        awareness. Participants in this track will help find
                        ways to raise this awareness and to look for better ways
                        to serve women's medical needs.

                    <p>
                        Access to healthcare is limited in rural and less
                        developed areas around the country and the world. It is
                        important to expand access to quality healthcare in
                        these areas, which could mean developing new
                        technologies and infrastructure to expand the range of
                        current medical services. Participants within this track
                        will design solutions that increase access to
                        healthcare, and/or find ways to make healthcare more
                        affordable.

                    <p>
                        A hackathon is an invention marathon where people work
                        in groups to build hardware and software projects
                        ranging from simple websites to motion controlled
                        drones. At this hackathon, you will be working in teams
                        of up to four people to create projects within our
                        <a href="#tracks">tracks</a>.

                    <p>
                        HealthTech is modeled after the tech industry’s
                        “hackathon” and aims to foster collaboration among
                        students from various disciplines by uniting them for
                        their passion within the healthcare fields. Students
                        will work with nonprofit organizations to solve pressing
                        problems — from mental health to geriatrics – faced by
                        these groups in order to make a tangible impact within
                        in their community.

                        We will have a virtual mixer at the start of the event
                        to help you find a team! Additionally, we will be making
                        a Facebook group for attendees to share their ideas and
                        find a team before the event.

                        Make sure to have a laptop, charger, headphones, and

                    <div class="question">Who can participate?</div>
                    <p>
                        Any student over the age of 18 is allowed to
                        participate. Teams can be up to four members - you can
                        register with your team when you apply, any time after
                        you're accepted, or create a team at the event! If you
                        are younger than 18, but a Georgia Tech student, you can
                        still participate.

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, since the event will be virtual we will
                        be unable to provide any materials or hardware, but you
                        are welcome to use anything you have access to.
